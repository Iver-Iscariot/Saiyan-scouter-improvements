Reverse enginered and improved models of chronos-FDM's saiyan scouter (https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2272830)

Designed to be easier to assemble using M3 screws and threaded inserts.
The arm is still only friction fit, but there is more material overlapping.
Finally, I have designed it to be attached to a hairband, so that it actually sits on your head
